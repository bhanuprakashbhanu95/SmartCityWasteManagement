This is an repository where we publish our project artifacts about the theme of Smart Cities Waste Management

## Presentation: 
Our project, "SmartWaste," is a machine learning approach that revolutionizes garbage image classification in the face of growing urban waste. Our technology employs sophisticated algorithms and neural networks to precisely classify waste photos into recyclables, non-recyclables, organics, and hazardous items, thereby mitigating the inefficiencies associated with manual sorting. Our goals in automating this process are to decrease the environmental effect, increase sustainability, and improve the efficiency of trash management. As a technologically advanced solution to optimize resource allocation, reduce landfill waste, and support worldwide environmental conservation efforts, SmartWaste represents an important step towards smart city initiatives.

## Business Need:
- Rapid emergence of smart cities worldwide
- Integration of Machine Learning for data  analytics
- Contribute to a cleaner, healthier urban  environment

## Problem Statement:
- first: Inefficient waste  management in  smart cities
- Second: Leads to  environmental  issues and higher  operational costs
- Third: Hinders  optimization of  waste management
- Fourth: Solution: Utilize  Machine Learning  for data analytics
